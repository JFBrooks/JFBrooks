- 👋 Hi, I’m @JFBrooks
- 👀 I’m interested in: Making and improving technical documentation, engaging with open-source projects and learning about things I'm completely new to.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: How best to maintain a local multimedia knowledgebase. After that, Python and maybe this time it'll stick.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Projects in need of documentation assistance--any and all! The more attempted, the more learned.
- 📫 How to reach me: Here, or via github@brooksworks.org.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: If you're a fan of the Matrix trilogy and haven't watched 'Dark City,' watch it ASAP.
